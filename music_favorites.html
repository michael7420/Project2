    <h4>MGMT - Kids</h4>
	  <p>
	    This is a song that is very nostalgic to me as I remeber always hearing it on the radio, but most importantly
		it's a song I remeber being in the first FIFA game I ever played, FIFA 09 on the Playstation 2. It was one of
		the only video games that I played when I first got introduced into gaming. I was around 7 years old at the time.

    <h4>Logic - 44 Bars</h4>
	  <p>
		A friend of mine was always playing Logic around me Freshman year of high school while I was listening to . I was never really interested
		into rap prior to this song, and one day I decided to try it out and it just so happened to be this song that changed me
		forever. Rap is my favorite genre by far, I'll always be able to find a rap song that perfectly correlates to the mood and
		the environment I'm in.

    <h4>Mac DeMarco - Chamber of Reflection</h4>
	  <p>
		I originally heard someone sample this song and rap over it and I was very fascinated by it. At the time, I remember I was in my
		Junior year of high school and I was looking specifically for music in the indie rock genre. Mac DeMarco introduced me to one of
		my favorite songs and many others. Eventually I got into music like reggae, rock, and even metal.

    <h4>Lykke Li - I Follow Rivers</h4>
	  <p>
		This is a song I've been recently listenting to. I've known this song for a very long time now, the reason as to why I'm coming
		back to it now is because it is a song I remeber frequently hearing on my vacation in Poland. There I was able to spend time with
		family, most importantly my cousins. It was a good time and music from vacation helps me reminisce on different memories and maintain
		my interest in my family.
