    <h4>General Introduction</h4>
	  <p>
		Hello everyone, my name is Michael Szewczyk! I'm glad to see you've made it to my website.
		I'd like to designate this part of the website to introducing myself a little more. I'm 20 
		years old, born and raised in Chicago's Northwestside. My family originates from Poland, making
		me one of the first generations of Americans in my family tree. I reside with my parents, younger 
		sister, and my toy sized Aussie puppy named Marlowe.

    <h4>Hobbies and Interests</h4>
	  <p>
		Growing up, I was introduced to activites like skiing, soccer, and biking, which are all activites that
		are close to my heart to this day. Although these are probably my favorite activities, I'm not able to do them
		as frequently as I want to. Something I do participate in every day is a work out from home. I'd like to start
		going to the gym in the near future as that is where I feel best physically and mentally. Some recent activities I
		gained an interest for are: MMA (Mixed Martial Arts), guitar, boxing, sailing, hiking, and swimming. One of my favortie athletes,
		Conor McGregor, first got me interested into UFC (Ultimate Fighting Championship) where they preform MMA. Later I started to follow boxing, 
		eventually getting my own boxing bag and training in my garage from time to time. With every storm comes the calm, I like fighting but 
		sailing provides me the meditative side to my life. My father introduced me to sailig which I am very thankful for, with time I gained
		an appreciation for the technology involved, the nature, adrenaline at times, and the connection that formulates a good crew. Sailing introduced me
		to swimming, an activity that promotes focus and self control which I gained a greater appreciation for recently. 
		An activity that closely relates to swimming is hiking. Although the activities are completely different, both are conceptually easy and goal oriented
		which is something that I look for within an activity. Hiking helps me understand patience in life, and that you must work hard and overcome various
		obstacles in order to enjoy the view from the top.
